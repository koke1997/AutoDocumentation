I need you to generate comprehensive documentation for this Scala code file.

Let me first load the code:
[TOOL: read_file]{{file_path}}[/TOOL]

Please create detailed reStructuredText (RST) documentation with:

1. A clear class/object heading with proper RST formatting
2. A detailed 2-3 sentence description explaining the purpose and role of this class
3. Complete documentation for ALL methods including:
   - Parameters with types and descriptions
   - Return types and descriptions
   - Usage examples where appropriate
4. Documentation for all fields/values with types and descriptions

Some important notes:
- DO NOT include any debugging messages like "Checking for updates"
- Ensure all documentation is complete and well-structured
- Use proper RST formatting for code references with double backticks
- Include a note at the top that documentation was auto-generated

When you're done, please save the documentation to:
[TOOL: save_documentation]{{output_file_path}}
<your generated RST content>
[/TOOL]
